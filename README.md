# E-commerce SQL Project

This project simulates an E-commerce backend system using SQL. It includes:
- Schema creation
- Sample data population
- Analytical and complex SQL queries

## Files

- **schema.sql**: Defines all table structures with keys and constraints
- **sample_data.sql**: Populates the tables with sample entries
- **queries.sql**: Contains analytical and practice queries including views, joins, and aggregations

## Key Concepts Covered

- SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER via UNION)
- Views
- Aggregation and Grouping
- Relational Modeling
- Analytical Queries

## How to Use

1. Execute `schema.sql` to create the database structure
2. Run `sample_data.sql` to insert sample records
3. Run and experiment with `queries.sql` to analyze the data
